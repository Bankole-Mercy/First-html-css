            On 19 March 2021, Burna Boy was featured on Canadian singer Justin
            Bieber's song, "Loved by You", a track from his sixth studio album,
            Justice. On 17 September 2021, he was featured on American
            singer-songwriter Jon Bellion's single, "I Feel It", which marks the
            first musical collaboration between the two, but the latter co-wrote
            "Loved by You" with Justin Bieber. On 4 June 2022, Burna Boy
            performed at the Belgravia Sports Stadium in Harare, Zimbabwe where
            he was allegedly offered, and twice refused, large sums of money to
            don a ZANU-PF scarf as an endorsement of the Mnangagwa
            adminstration.
